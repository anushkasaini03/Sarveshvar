                        <p>Explore the parallels between the Big Bang theory and ancient cosmological myths.the Big Bang theory, describing the universe’s explosive birth from a singularity, echoes ancient Hindu cosmology. Carl Sagan's notion that "The cosmos is within us" parallels the Hindu idea of "Tat Tvam Asi" (You are That), revealing the intrinsic unity between the individual and the universe. Just as the Big Bang signifies a cosmic beginning, Hindu scriptures such as the Rigveda narrate the universe emerging from the primordial "Bindu," a symbolic point of creation. This connection underscores a timeless narrative of cosmic origins shared across scientific and spiritual realms.

Stephen Hawking’s insights about black holes as regions of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape resonate with the Hindu concept of "Shiva," the cosmic destroyer. In Hindu myth, black holes can be seen as symbolic of the destructive aspect of Shiva’s cosmic dance, leading to transformation and rebirth. This parallel invites contemplation on how ancient mythology can provide profound insights into modern astrophysical phenomena.

Quantum theory suggests that particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, akin to the Hindu belief in "Maya" (illusion), where reality is perceived as a flux of illusionary forms. This comparison illustrates how ancient philosophies anticipated modern scientific discoveries about the nature of reality, revealing a deep, underlying coherence between mythological wisdom and quantum physics.

The idea of multiple universes mirrors the Hindu notion of "Yugas," vast epochs in a cosmic cycle where numerous universes are created, destroyed, and reborn. As physicist David Deutsch notes, “The multiverse is a fundamental part of the reality we live in,” aligning with the ancient belief that our universe is one of many in an endless cycle of cosmic creation.
